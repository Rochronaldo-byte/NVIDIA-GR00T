GR00T N1 features a dual-system architecture inspired by human cognition, consisting of the following complementary components:

Vision-Language Model (System 2): This methodical thinking system is based on NVIDIA-Eagle with SmolLM-1.7B. It interprets the environment through vision and language instructions, enabling robots to reason about their environment and instructions, and plan the right actions.
Diffusion Transformer (System 1): This action model generates continuous actions to control the robotâ€™s movements, translating the action plan made by System 2 into precise, continuous robot movements.
